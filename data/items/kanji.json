Do make sure you take this story to a ridiculous enough level to hook a memory into that brain of yours. Be mad at him for not following construction site regulations (where's his shirt, shoes, and pants!?). Why is he using that bulldozer like that?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, say you really do like what you see (you're going to have to imagine a much better looking version of <ja>こういち</ja>'s actual face, though). You and <ja>こういち</ja> make eye contact a little too long. He nods, puts his cigarette out, and takes off his hard hat, letting his long Fabio-esque locks flow. You beckon him over and he comes. What happens next is up to you and your own imagination. My guess is you have a very deep conversation about kanji and the best ways to learn it.\r\n\r\nHint: When you see <ja>工</ja> in a kanji it will often take the <ja>こう</ja> reading. Remember that, because it comes up quite a bit!"
